    <h2>Project Experience</h2>
    <h3>TAME Visualization Platform, SYSTRA - Web Application Development</h3>
    <p>
        Contributed to the development of the TfN TAME Visualization Platform, a web application for Transport for the North (TfN) in the UK. This platform visualizes transport modelling data through interactive maps, including elements such as bus accessibility, bus reliability, zones, stations, and nodes. Worked on both front-end and back-end components, utilizing React.js for the user interface, .NET for backend operations, and PostgreSQL for database management. Assisted in integrating these components to ensure a cohesive and functional application, enhancing the platform's data representation and user experience.

    <h3>Makkah Transport Model, SYSTRA - Data Analysis</h3>
    <p>
        Conducted data analysis and visualization for the Makkah Transport Model project, employing Python to automate the filtering and formatting of essential data. Developed visualizations using Excel charts and utilized QGIS for ATC analysis, classifying ATC points based on JT Routes. Performed comprehensive data analysis and visualization for 10 surveys, implementing automated calculations to enhance efficiency and ensure accuracy in the analytical processes.
    </p>
    <h3>Inverness (Kessock Bridge) Project, SYSTRA - Web Scraping</h3>
    <p>
        Automated the web scraping process for extracting ATC point information from a website related to the Kessock Bridge in Inverness, organized by direction, using the Selenium library in Python. Developed a streamlined workflow that included data extraction and storage in an Excel sheet according to the client's specified format. The entire process, from data scraping to storage, was fully automated, enhancing efficiency and accuracy in handling the required information.
